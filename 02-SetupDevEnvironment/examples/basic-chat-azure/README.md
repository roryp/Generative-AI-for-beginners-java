# Basic Chat with Azure AI Foundry - End-to-End Example

This example is a simple Spring Boot application that connects to an **Azure AI Foundry** model using **keyless authentication** (Microsoft Entra ID) and tests your setup. It keeps Spring AI's `ChatClient`, backed by the **official OpenAI Java SDK** and the **Azure OpenAI v1** endpoint.

The versions in [pom.xml](./pom.xml) are Spring Boot **4.1.1**, Spring AI **2.0.1**, OpenAI Java **4.63.1**, Azure Identity **1.18.6**, and dotenv-java **3.2.0**. The sample uses `spring-ai-starter-model-openai` and explicitly declares `openai-java` and `azure-identity`; Spring AI 2 removed the old Azure OpenAI starter.

## Prerequisites

Before running this example, ensure you have:

- An Azure AI Foundry resource with a `gpt-5.6-luna` deployment - provision it with `azd up` or manually via the [Azure AI Foundry setup guide](../../getting-started-azure-openai.md)
- The **Cognitive Services OpenAI User** role on that resource (the Bicep templates assign this for you)
- The [Azure CLI (`az`)](https://learn.microsoft.com/cli/azure/install-azure-cli), signed in with `az login`
- Java 21+ and Maven 3.9+

> **No API key required** — authentication is keyless via Microsoft Entra ID.

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Navigate to project
cd 02-SetupDevEnvironment/examples/basic-chat-azure

# 2. Sign in so keyless auth can get a token
az login

# 3. Configure the endpoint
#    - If you ran `azd up`, .env was written for you (skip this).
#    - Otherwise copy the template and set AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT:
cp .env.example .env

# 4. Run the application
mvn spring-boot:run
```

## How Authentication Works

This example authenticates with **Microsoft Entra ID** — there is no API key.

The application configures authentication explicitly in [BasicChatApplication.java](./src/main/java/com/example/BasicChatApplication.java):

1. `azureCredential()` creates a `BearerTokenCredential` using `AuthenticationUtil.getBearerTokenSupplier` with `DefaultAzureCredential` and the `https://ai.azure.com/.default` scope.
2. `azureOpenAiClient()` builds an `OpenAIClient` with `OpenAIOkHttpClient.builder()`, resolves the resource endpoint to `/openai/v1`, and supplies the bearer credential with `.credential(...)`.
3. `azureChatModel()` supplies that client to Spring AI's `OpenAiChatModel`, which backs the lesson's `ChatClient`.

These explicit beans keep a global `OPENAI_API_KEY` from overriding Azure authentication. Omitting an API key from YAML alone is not the authentication setup. `DefaultAzureCredential` can use your `az login` session locally or a managed identity in Azure; whichever identity is selected must have the resource role listed above.

## Running the Application

### Using Maven

```bash
mvn spring-boot:run
```

### Using VS Code

1. Open the project in VS Code
2. Press `F5` or use the "Run and Debug" panel
3. Select "Spring Boot-BasicChatApplication" configuration

> **Note**: The application loads `.env` from its working directory, including when launched from VS Code.

### Expected Output

Illustrative output after a successful run (startup logs omitted; response wording varies):

```text
Starting Basic Chat with Azure OpenAI...
Environment variables loaded from .env file
Endpoint: https://your-resource.openai.azure.com/
Deployment: gpt-5.6-luna
Auth: keyless (Microsoft Entra ID via DefaultAzureCredential)
Connecting to Azure OpenAI...
Sending prompt: What is AI in a short sentence? Max 100 words.

AI Response:
================
AI, or Artificial Intelligence, is the simulation of human intelligence in machines programmed to think and learn like humans.
================

Success! Azure OpenAI connection is working correctly.
```

## Configuration Reference

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Description | Required | Example |
|----------|-------------|----------|---------|
| `AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT` | Foundry (Azure OpenAI) endpoint URL | Yes | `https://my-resource.openai.azure.com/` |
| `AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT` | Chat model deployment name | No | `gpt-5.6-luna` (default) |

> There is **no** API key variable — authentication is keyless (Microsoft Entra ID via `az login`).

### Spring Configuration

The [application.yml](./src/main/resources/application.yml) settings use the `spring.ai.openai` prefix and flattened chat properties (no `options` block):

```yaml
spring:
  ai:
    openai:
      base-url: ${AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT}
      microsoft-foundry: true
      chat:
        model: ${AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT:gpt-5.6-luna}
        reasoning-effort: none
        max-completion-tokens: 500
```

`model` is the **Azure deployment name**. Authentication comes from the explicit beans described above, not an `api-key` setting. The lesson disables reasoning and caps completion tokens at 500; it leaves `temperature` and the legacy `max-tokens` unset.

Microsoft recommends the [official OpenAI SDK with Azure OpenAI v1 and the Responses API for new applications](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/foundry/openai/supported-languages?pivots=programming-language-java). Chat Completions remains supported for this existing message-based lesson. For GPT-5.6, requests that include tools on Chat Completions must set `reasoning_effort` to `none`; use Responses when combining reasoning with tools. See [tool calling with reasoning models](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/foundry/openai/how-to/reasoning#tool-calling-with-reasoning-models).

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

<details>
<summary><strong>Error: 401 / "PermissionDenied" / token errors</strong></summary>

- Run `az login` — keyless auth needs an active sign-in to get a token
- Verify your account has the **Cognitive Services OpenAI User** role on the resource
- If you just assigned the role, wait a minute for it to propagate
- Confirm you're in the right tenant/subscription (`az account show`)
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Error: "The endpoint is not valid" / connection errors</strong></summary>

- Ensure `AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT` is the full base URL (e.g., `https://your-resource.openai.azure.com/`)
- Check for trailing slash consistency
- Verify the endpoint matches your provisioned resource (`azd env get-values`)
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Error: "The deployment was not found"</strong></summary>

- Verify `AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT` matches a deployment name in Azure
- Check that the model is successfully deployed and active
- The default deployment name is `gpt-5.6-luna`
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Error: 429 / rate limit exceeded</strong></summary>

- The default GPT-5.6 Luna deployment has Global Standard capacity 10: 10 requests/minute and 10,000 tokens/minute
- Run examples sequentially and wait for the service's retry interval before retrying
- This basic example disables automatic SDK retries, so a failed request is reported directly
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>VS Code: Environment variables not loading</strong></summary>

- Ensure your `.env` file is in the project root directory (same level as `pom.xml`)
- Try running `mvn spring-boot:run` in VS Code's integrated terminal
- Check that the VS Code Java extension is properly installed
</details>

### Debug Mode

To enable detailed logging, uncomment these lines in [application.yml](./src/main/resources/application.yml):

```yaml
logging:
  level:
    "[org.springframework.ai]": DEBUG
    "[com.azure]": DEBUG
```
