# Practical Applications & Projects

## Wetin You Go Learn
For dis section, we go show three practical applications wey dey showcase generative AI development patterns with Java:
- Create one multi-modal Pet Story Generator wey dey combine client-side and server-side AI
- Implement local AI model integration with the Foundry Local Spring Boot demo
- Develop one Model Context Protocol (MCP) service with the Calculator example

## Introduction

Dis chapter dey showcase **sample projects** wey dey show generative AI development patterns with Java. Each project dey work well and e dey show specific AI technologies, architectural patterns, and best practices wey you fit use for your own applications.

### Foundry Local Spring Boot Demo

The **[Foundry Local Spring Boot Demo](foundrylocal/README.md)** dey show how to integrate with local AI models using the **OpenAI Java SDK**. E dey show how to connect to the **Phi-3.5-mini** model wey dey run on Foundry Local, so you fit run AI applications without dey depend on cloud services.

### Pet Story Generator

The **[Pet Story Generator](petstory/README.md)** na one interesting Spring Boot web application wey dey show **multi-modal AI processing** to generate creative pet stories. E dey combine client-side and server-side AI capabilities using transformer.js for browser-based AI interactions and the OpenAI SDK for server-side processing.

### MCP Calculator Service (Beginner-Friendly MCP Demo)

The **[MCP Calculator Service](calculator/README.md)** na simple demo of the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** using Spring AI. E dey provide beginner-friendly introduction to MCP concepts, dey show how to create one basic MCP Server wey dey interact with MCP clients.

## Learning Progression

Dis projects dey designed to build on top of wetin you don learn for previous chapters:

1. **Start Small**: Begin with the Foundry Local Spring Boot Demo to understand basic AI integration with local models
2. **Add Interactivity**: Move to the Pet Story Generator for multi-modal AI and web-based interactions
3. **Learn MCP Basics**: Try the MCP Calculator Service to understand Model Context Protocol fundamentals

## Summary

Good job! You don explore some real applications:

- Multi-modal AI experiences wey dey work for browser and server
- Local AI model integration using modern Java frameworks and SDKs
- Your first Model Context Protocol service to see how tools dey integrate with AI

## Next Steps
