# Generative AI for Beginners - Java Edition

**Time Commitment**: You can complete the entire workshop online without needing a local setup. If you want to run the examples, setting up the environment takes about 2 minutes, and exploring the samples can take 1-3 hours depending on how deeply you dive into them.

> **Quick Start**

1. Fork this repository to your GitHub account.
2. Click **Code** → **Codespaces** tab → **...** → **New with options...**
3. Use the default settings – this will select the Development container created for this course.
4. Click **Create codespace**.
5. Wait approximately 2 minutes for the environment to be ready.
6. Jump directly to [Creating your GitHub Models Token](./02-SetupDevEnvironment/README.md#step-2-create-a-github-personal-access-token).
