# Practical Applications & Projects

## What You'll Learn
In this section, we'll explore three practical applications that highlight generative AI development patterns using Java:
- Build a multi-modal Pet Story Generator that combines client-side and server-side AI
- Integrate local AI models with the Foundry Local Spring Boot demo
- Create a Model Context Protocol (MCP) service using the Calculator example

## Introduction

This chapter features **sample projects** that illustrate generative AI development patterns with Java. Each project is fully functional and demonstrates specific AI technologies, architectural approaches, and best practices that you can apply to your own applications.

### Foundry Local Spring Boot Demo

The **[Foundry Local Spring Boot Demo](foundrylocal/README.md)** showcases how to integrate local AI models using the **OpenAI Java SDK**. It demonstrates connecting to the **Phi-3.5-mini** model running on Foundry Local, enabling you to develop AI applications without relying on cloud services.

### Pet Story Generator

The **[Pet Story Generator](petstory/README.md)** is a fun Spring Boot web application that demonstrates **multi-modal AI processing** to create imaginative pet stories. It combines client-side and server-side AI capabilities, using transformer.js for browser-based AI interactions and the OpenAI SDK for server-side processing.

### MCP Calculator Service (Beginner-Friendly MCP Demo)

The **[MCP Calculator Service](mcp/calculator/README.md)** is a straightforward example of the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** implemented with Spring AI. It provides an easy introduction to MCP concepts, showing how to build a basic MCP Server that interacts with MCP clients.

## Learning Progression

These projects are structured to build on concepts introduced in earlier chapters:

1. **Start Simple**: Begin with the Foundry Local Spring Boot Demo to learn basic AI integration with local models
2. **Add Interactivity**: Move on to the Pet Story Generator to explore multi-modal AI and web-based interactions
3. **Learn MCP Basics**: Experiment with the MCP Calculator Service to grasp the fundamentals of the Model Context Protocol

## Summary

**Well done!** You have successfully:

- **Created multi-modal AI experiences** that combine client-side and server-side AI processing
- **Integrated local AI models** using modern Java frameworks and SDKs
- **Developed Model Context Protocol services** that demonstrate tool integration patterns
