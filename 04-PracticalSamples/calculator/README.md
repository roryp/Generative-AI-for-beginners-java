## What You Will Learn

This tutorial explains how to build a calculator service using the Model Context Protocol (MCP). You'll understand:

- How to create a service that AI can use as a tool
- How to set up direct communication with MCP services
- How AI models can automatically choose which tools to use
- The difference between direct protocol calls and AI-assisted interactions

## Prerequisites

Before starting, make sure you have:
- Java 21 or higher installed
- Maven for dependency management
- Basic understanding of Java and Spring Boot

Only the AI clients require an Azure OpenAI deployment and an authenticated `DefaultAzureCredential`,
such as an existing Azure CLI sign-in locally or a managed identity in Azure. The identity needs
the Cognitive Services OpenAI User role on the resource. See [Chapter 2](../../02-SetupDevEnvironment/getting-started-azure-openai.md).
The server, direct SDK client, and all automated tests need no Azure account or model access.

## Dependency Versions

Release dependencies verified on 2026-09-14:

| Dependency | Version |
| --- | --- |
| Spring Boot | 4.1.1 |
| Spring AI | 2.0.1 |
| MCP Java SDK (Spring AI-managed) | 2.0.0 |
| LangChain4j / core | 1.20.0 |
| LangChain4j MCP | 1.20.0-beta30 |
| LangChain4j official OpenAI adapter | 1.20.0-beta30 |
| OpenAI Java SDK | 4.63.1 |
| Azure Identity | 1.18.6 |
| JUnit Jupiter (Boot-managed) | 6.0.3 |

The MCP and official OpenAI adapters are published beta releases in Maven Central, not snapshots.
Their versions differ from LangChain4j core. No snapshot or milestone repositories are needed.
Client-only dependencies have test scope because the runnable examples live under `src/test/java`.

## Understanding the Project Structure

The calculator project has several important files:

```
calculator/
├── src/main/java/com/microsoft/mcp/sample/server/
│   ├── McpServerApplication.java          # Main Spring Boot app
│   └── service/CalculatorService.java     # Calculator operations
└── src/test/java/com/microsoft/mcp/sample/client/
    ├── SDKClient.java                     # Direct MCP communication
    ├── LangChain4jClient.java            # AI-powered client
    └── Bot.java                          # Chat interface and interactive entrypoint
```

## Core Components Explained

### 1. Main Application

**File:** `McpServerApplication.java`

This is the entry point of our calculator service. It's a standard Spring Boot application with one special addition:

```java
@SpringBootApplication
public class McpServerApplication {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(McpServerApplication.class, args);
    }
    
    @Bean
    public ToolCallbackProvider calculatorTools(CalculatorService calculator) {
        return MethodToolCallbackProvider.builder().toolObjects(calculator).build();
    }
}
```

**What this does:**
- Starts a Spring Boot web server on port 8080
- Creates a `ToolCallbackProvider` that makes our calculator methods available as MCP tools
- The `@Bean` annotation tells Spring to manage this as a component that other parts can use

### 2. Calculator Service

**File:** `CalculatorService.java`

This is where all the math happens. Each method is marked with `@Tool` to make it available through MCP:

```java
@Service
public class CalculatorService {

    @Tool(description = "Add two numbers together")
    public String add(double a, double b) {
        double result = a + b;
        return formatResult(a, "+", b, result);
    }

    @Tool(description = "Subtract the second number from the first number")
    public String subtract(double a, double b) {
        double result = a - b;
        return formatResult(a, "-", b, result);
    }
    
    // More calculator operations...
    
    private String formatResult(double a, String operator, double b, double result) {
        return String.format(java.util.Locale.ROOT, "%.2f %s %.2f = %.2f", a, operator, b, result);
    }
}
```

**Key features:**

1. **`@Tool` Annotation**: This tells MCP that this method can be called by external clients
2. **Clear Descriptions**: Each tool has a description that helps AI models understand when to use it
3. **Consistent Return Format**: All operations return human-readable strings like "5.00 + 3.00 = 8.00"
4. **Error Handling**: Division by zero and negative square roots return error messages

**Available Operations:**
- `add(a, b)` - Adds two numbers
- `subtract(a, b)` - Subtracts second from first
- `multiply(a, b)` - Multiplies two numbers
- `divide(a, b)` - Divides first by second (with zero-check)
- `power(base, exponent)` - Raises base to the power of exponent
- `squareRoot(number)` - Calculates square root (with negative check)
- `modulus(a, b)` - Returns remainder of division
- `absolute(number)` - Returns absolute value
- `help()` - Returns information about all operations

### 3. Direct MCP Client

See [SDKClient.java](src/test/java/com/microsoft/mcp/sample/client/SDKClient.java).

This client uses `HttpClientStreamableHttpTransport` at `/mcp`, initializes the connection,
pings the server, and follows tool-list pagination. It checks that all nine expected tools
exist and calls each of them, including `modulus` and `help`, without an AI model.

The current request builder looks like this:

```java
var request = CallToolRequest.builder("add")
    .arguments(Map.of("a", 5.0, "b", 3.0))
    .build();
var result = client.callTool(request);
```

Protocol errors fail the client instead of printing a misleading success. The MCP client
is closed with try-with-resources, including when discovery or a tool call fails.

### 4. AI-Powered Client

See [LangChain4jClient.java](src/test/java/com/microsoft/mcp/sample/client/LangChain4jClient.java)
and [Bot.java](src/test/java/com/microsoft/mcp/sample/client/Bot.java).

`OpenAiOfficialChatModel` implements the current LangChain4j `ChatModel` API.
`StreamableHttpMcpTransport` connects it to the same `/mcp` endpoint as the SDK client.
`AiServices` discovers the tools and manages the tool-call/result conversation.

The default deployment is **GPT-5.6 Luna**, with reasoning explicitly disabled:

```java
var parameters = OpenAiOfficialChatRequestParameters.builder()
    .modelName("gpt-5.6-luna")
    .reasoningEffort("none")
    .maxCompletionTokens(1024)
    .parallelToolCalls(false)
    .build();
```

These defaults apply to every completion, including follow-ups after tool execution.
The client uses a refreshable `BearerTokenCredential` backed by `DefaultAzureCredential`
and the `https://ai.azure.com/.default` scope, not a one-time token passed as an API key.
Resource URLs and URLs already ending in `/openai/v1` are both accepted.

The bot keeps a bounded conversation history, prints `Tool executed: ...` with the actual
MCP result, and fails if a response skips tools. Tool loops are limited to four round trips.
Authentication, model, MCP, and tool errors propagate; automatic model retries are disabled.
Both the MCP transport/client and the official OpenAI client are closed on success or failure.

## Running the Examples

### Step 1: Start the Calculator Server

No Azure configuration is needed for the server. Commands below run from this sample's directory.
The example uses port **18081** to avoid conflicting with another sample; the default remains 8080.

```powershell
cd 04-PracticalSamples/calculator
mvn spring-boot:run "-Dspring-boot.run.arguments=--server.port=18081"
```

The MCP endpoint is `http://localhost:18081/mcp`. Health and discovery information are at
`http://localhost:18081/health` and `http://localhost:18081/info`.
Streamable HTTP replaces the old SSE-only transport; `/sse` and `/v1/tools` are not endpoints.

### Step 2: Test with Direct Client

In another PowerShell terminal:

```powershell
cd 04-PracticalSamples/calculator
$env:MCP_SERVER_URL = "http://localhost:18081"
mvn test-compile exec:java "-Dexec.mainClass=com.microsoft.mcp.sample.client.SDKClient" "-Dexec.classpathScope=test"
```

No input is needed. All nine tools are exercised. Expected arithmetic results include
8, 6, 42, 5, 256, 4, 2, and 5.5, followed by the help text.

### Step 3: Test with AI Client

After authenticating as described in the prerequisites, configure the AI client in the same terminal:

```powershell
$env:AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT = "https://your-resource.openai.azure.com/"
$env:AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT = "gpt-5.6-luna"
mvn test-compile exec:java "-Dexec.mainClass=com.microsoft.mcp.sample.client.LangChain4jClient" "-Dexec.classpathScope=test" "-Dexec.args=--prompt 'Calculate the sum of 24.5 and 17.3 using the calculator service'"
```

Expect a `Tool executed: add` line with `41.80`, followed by the model's answer.
The single-prompt mode exits without waiting for input. To run the original four-prompt demo:

```powershell
mvn test-compile exec:java "-Dexec.mainClass=com.microsoft.mcp.sample.client.LangChain4jClient" "-Dexec.classpathScope=test" "-Dexec.args=--demo"
```

The demo calls `add`, `squareRoot`, `help`, and the chained `power` then `divide` operation.
Expected numeric answers are 41.8, 12, and 64. Omitting arguments also runs this demo.

### Step 4: Run the Interactive Bot

```powershell
mvn test-compile exec:java "-Dexec.mainClass=com.microsoft.mcp.sample.client.Bot" "-Dexec.classpathScope=test"
```

Enter `Multiply 6 by 7 using the calculator service`, then `exit` or `quit`.
Expect an actual `multiply` tool result of 42. Blank lines are ignored; EOF also ends the session.
For a noninteractive smoke test of this entrypoint:

```powershell
mvn test-compile exec:java "-Dexec.mainClass=com.microsoft.mcp.sample.client.Bot" "-Dexec.classpathScope=test" "-Dexec.args=--prompt 'Multiply 6 by 7 using the calculator service'"
```

Both AI entrypoints accept `--prompt "question"`, `--demo`, and `--interactive`.
Invalid options fail before opening a connection. Each Maven `-D...` argument is fully quoted
for PowerShell. On Bash, use `export NAME=value` instead of `$env:NAME = "value"`.

**Quota:** Run AI samples sequentially. A simple prompt normally needs two model requests;
the complete demo normally needs nine, including tool-result follow-ups. With a shared 10 RPM
deployment, allow a fresh quota window before the next AI run. A 429 fails visibly without
automatic retries; follow the service's retry-after guidance. Actual request counts depend on the model.
Offline tests do not consume any quota and do not establish live Luna availability or answer quality.

### Configuration and Shutdown

| Setting | Default / behavior |
| --- | --- |
| `MCP_SERVER_URL` | `http://localhost:8080`; base URL, without `/mcp` |
| `-Dmcp.server.url=...` | Overrides `MCP_SERVER_URL` for all clients |
| `AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT` | Required only for AI clients; resource URL or `/openai/v1` URL |
| `AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT` | `gpt-5.6-luna`; an Azure deployment name |
| `AZURE_OPENAI_MAX_COMPLETION_TOKENS` | `1024`; positive integer |
| Reasoning effort | Always `none`, including tool-loop follow-ups |

An overridden deployment must support `reasoning_effort=none` and `max_completion_tokens`.
The clients do not read a `.env` file automatically. Stop the server with `Ctrl+C` after testing.
Clients return normally without `System.exit` or shutdown sleeps.

## Offline Tests

```powershell
mvn -B -ntp clean verify
```

All tests are offline with respect to Azure: the protocol suite starts a Spring server and
an OpenAI-compatible stub on random loopback ports, then closes them. Maven may still need
to download dependencies. No credentials, live deployment, or pre-existing MCP server are used.

- Calculator unit tests cover all arithmetic operations, decimal results, help, and domain errors.
- MCP tests cover initialization, discovery, all nine tool calls, tool failures, and health/info.
- The AI protocol tests execute the full demo and interactive Bot against the real calculator,
  verify tool results feed the next completion, and inspect every HTTP body for Luna,
  `reasoning_effort: "none"`, and `max_completion_tokens` with no legacy `max_tokens`.
- Configuration/input tests cover deployment and endpoint overrides, blank lines, EOF, exit/quit,
  single-prompt mode, invalid options, and error propagation. Quota tests prove 429 is not retried.

## How It All Works Together

Here's the complete flow when you ask the AI "What's 5 + 3?":

1. **You** ask the AI in natural language
2. **AI** analyzes your request and realizes you want addition
3. **AI** calls the MCP server: `add(5.0, 3.0)`
4. **Calculator Service** performs: `5.0 + 3.0 = 8.0`
5. **Calculator Service** returns: `"5.00 + 3.00 = 8.00"`
6. **AI** receives the result and formats a natural response
7. **You** get: "The sum of 5 and 3 is 8"
